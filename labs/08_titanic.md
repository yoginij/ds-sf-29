## Class 8 Exercise: Predicting Survival on the Titanic

This assignment uses data from Kaggle's [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) competition. `titanic.csv` is in the repo, so there is no need to download the data from the Kaggle website.

**Tasks:**

1. Read `titanic.csv` into a DataFrame.
2. What is the null accuracy rate for predicting survival? (recall this means the probability of choosing the largest unique category, either survived or not)
3. Can you think of some variables that are in the dataset that might contribute to predicting survival of the crash?
4. Define Pclass and Parch as the features, and Survived as the response.
5. Split the data into training and testing sets. (Hint: use the train test split modules from sklearn)
6. Fit a logistic regression model and examine the coefficients to confirm that they make intuitive sense.
7. Make predictions on the testing set and calculate the accuracy.
8. Create a confusion matrix and document the model's sensitivity and specificity. (remember you should run metrics on your test classes!)
9. Also include Age as a feature, and calculate the testing accuracy. There will be a small issue you'll have to deal with. What is it? How will you deal with it?
10. Try to make up a new column (be creative!) that you think might be helpful. For example one student make a column called "is_married" which was a combination of SibSp and the name column and include this new column.
11. In any of your models, were you able to beat the null accuracy rate?



Always remember to fit your model on the training data and run metrics on the test set.
