####Agenda


####Homework
* Project 2 is Due next Week!!

####Resources:

* [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/) allows you to explore tons of different APIs. Alternatively, a Python API wrapper is available for many popular APIs.
* [The Data Science Toolkit](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/) is a collection of location-based and text-related APIs.
* [API Integration in Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/api-integration-in-python/) provides a very readable introduction to REST APIs.
* [Microsoft's Face Detection API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api#detection), which powers [How-Old.net](https://how-old.net/), is a great example of how a machine learning API can be leveraged to produce a compelling web application.
Web Scraping Resources:
* For a much longer web scraping tutorial covering Beautiful Soup, lxml, XPath, and Selenium, watch [Web Scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iX0uxM1w8) (3 hours 23 minutes) from PyCon 2014. The slides and code are also available.
* [import.io](https://www.import.io/) and [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) claim to allow you to scrape websites without writing any code. Its alrighhhtttttt
* [How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/) to Find True Love and [How Netflix Reverse Engineered](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/?single_page=true) Hollywood are two fun examples of how web scraping has been used to build interesting datasets.
